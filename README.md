13-04-2024 : STARTING THE LEARNING PATH WITH CODECHEF CLUB FROM SRM RMP ON JAVASCRIPT. GOAL IS TO REVISIT JAVASCRIPT AND LEARN SOMETHING NEW THROUGHOUT THIS JOURNEY. FIRST DAY WENT THROUGH MY PROJECTS I ALREADY MADE WITH BOTH CORE JS AND FRONTEND DOM MANIPULATION SO THAT IT HELPS ME DUST MY SKILLS AND MAKE WAY FOR A SMOOTHER REVISION JOURNEY.

18-02-2024 : COMPLETED AND UPDATED FIRST PROJECT IN THIS REVISION JOURNEY. THE PROJECT BUILT IS A BASIC FROTNEND QR CODE GENERATOR WEB APPLICATION THAT TAKES INPUT OF A USER ABOUT THE MSG TO EMBED INSIDE THE QR AND GENERATES A QR CODE THAT HAS EMBEDDED THE TEXT AND THE TEXT OR LINK CAN BE ACCESSED BY SCANNNING THE QR CODE WITH A QR CODE SCANNER. 

20-02-2024 : COMPLETED MY SECOND MINI PROJECT NEXT TO TNE QR CODE GENERATOR. THIS WEB APP CALCULATES THE AGE BY ENTERING THE BIRTH DATE AS AN INPUT AND GENERATES THE AGE WITH THE OUTPUT WITH THE YEAR, M0NTHS , DATE. THIS PROJECT IS ONE WHICH I'VE STARTED BEFORE THIS REVISION SESSION. BUT STOPPED DUE TO SOME REASON. BUT RESTARTED THIS PROJECT TO REVISE MY DOM JOURNEY AND I GUESS THIS MINI PROJECT GAVE A BETTER ROUTE WITH THE REVISION JOURNEY.
